## Validation

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Navigate to `/clients` - list, create, edit, delete work
- [ ] Navigate to `/cases` - list, create, edit, delete work
- [ ] Navigate to `/hearings` - list, create, edit, delete work
- [ ] Navigate to `/lawyers` - list, create, edit, delete work (admin only)
- [ ] Language switching works (EN ↔ AR)
- [ ] RTL layout works correctly in Arabic
- [ ] Permissions are enforced (non-admin cannot access lawyers)
- [ ] Form validation works (try submitting empty forms)
- [ ] Relationships display correctly (case shows client, hearing shows case)
- [ ] Soft deletes work (deleted items go to trash)
- [ ] Activity log captures all CRUD operations

## Technical Decisions

### Route Ordering
- Placed specific routes (`/create`, `/edit`) before parameterized routes (`/{id}`)
- Prevents 404 errors when accessing create/edit URLs

### Permission Strategy
- Cases, Hearings: Standard CRUD permissions (`view`, `create`, `edit`, `delete`)
- Lawyers: Admin-only access using `admin.users.manage` permission
- All routes protected with middleware

### Validation Rules
- At least one name required (Arabic OR English) for all entities
- Date validation for hearings (next_hearing >= date)
- Email validation for lawyers
- Numeric validation for amounts in cases

### Language Keys Organization
- Grouped by module (Clients, Cases, Hearings, Lawyers)
- Shared keys (actions, common labels) at top level
- Module-specific keys in dedicated sections

---

## Errors Encountered & Fixes

None - implementation went smoothly with proper planning and route ordering.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Create factories and comprehensive Pest tests for all CRUD operations
2. **Additional CRUD**: Implement Contacts, Engagement Letters, Power of Attorneys, Admin Tasks
3. **Global Search**: Implement T-09 global search across all entities
4. **Advanced Features**: Filtering, sorting, bulk operations
5. **API**: RESTful API endpoints for all CRUD operations
