**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Branches**: `feat/trash-snapshot-schema`, `feat/trash-service-trait`, `feat/trash-collectors-all-models`, `feat/trash-cli-and-ui`, `test/trash-restore`, `docs/trash-adr-runbook`  
**Task**: Trash System — Complete Enterprise Recycle Bin  
**Status**: Completed  

---

## Summary
Implemented a comprehensive deletion bundle / recycle bin system that captures snapshots of deleted entities with their entire relationship graphs, supports restoration with conflict resolution, provides CLI commands and web UI for management, and includes full test coverage.

---

## Architecture

### Components
1. **Database Schema** (`deletion_bundles`, `deletion_bundle_items`)
2. **Eloquent Models** (`DeletionBundle`, `DeletionBundleItem`)
3. **Service Layer** (`DeletionBundleService`)
4. **Collector Pattern** (10 collectors for different model types)
5. **Model Trait** (`InteractsWithDeletionBundles`)
6. **CLI Commands** (`trash:list`, `trash:restore`, `trash:purge`)
7. **Web UI** (Bootstrap 5 admin interface)
8. **Policy & Permissions** (`TrashPolicy`, 3 permissions)
9. **Tests** (13 Pest tests, 87 assertions)
10. **Documentation** (ADR, Runbook)

## Features Implemented

### Snapshot Capture
- Automatic bundle creation on model deletion via trait
- Supports 10 model types (Client, Case, Document, Hearing, Task, etc.)
- Captures full relationship graph
- Stores file descriptors for documents
- Tracks cascade count and metadata

### Restoration System
- Dry-run mode for simulation
- Conflict resolution strategies (skip, overwrite, new_copy)
- Orphan handling (skip if parent missing)
- Transaction-wrapped for safety
- Detailed restore reports

### CLI Tools
- `trash:list`: Paginated list with filtering (type, status, limit)
- `trash:restore`: Restore with options (dry-run, conflict strategy)
- `trash:purge`: Single or bulk purge (--older-than)
- Statistics display (by type, by status)
- Progress bars for bulk operations

### Web UI
- Bootstrap 5 responsive interface
- Dashboard with statistics cards
- Filter form (type, status)
- Paginated table with actions
- Bundle detail page with item breakdown
- Dry-run modal with AJAX
- Restore/purge buttons with confirmations

### Configuration
- `config/trash.php`: Enable/disable per model
- Collector mapping
- TTL defaults (90 days)
- Restore defaults

| Client | ✅ | Full cascade: cases → hearings → tasks → subtasks + contacts + POAs + documents |
| CaseModel | ✅ | Hearings, tasks, subtasks, case documents |
| ClientDocument | ✅ | Single entity + file descriptor |
| Hearing | ✅ | Single entity + case/lawyer references |
| AdminTask | ✅ | Task + all subtasks |
| AdminSubtask | ✅ | Single entity + task reference |
| EngagementLetter | ✅ | Single entity + client reference |
| PowerOfAttorney | ✅ | Single entity + client reference |
| Contact | ✅ | Single entity + client reference |
| Lawyer | ✅ | Single entity + assignment metadata |

## Issues Encountered & Fixes

### Issue 1: Trait Method Collision
**Symptom**: `isForceDeleting()` collision between InteractsWithDeletionBundles and SoftDeletes  
**Root Cause**: Both traits defined same method  
**Fix**: Removed override from custom trait, added `checkIsForceDeleting()` helper

### Issue 2: Test Static Method Call
**Symptom**: `withoutBundle()` cannot be called statically  
**Root Cause**: Method is instance method, not static  
**Fix**: Simplified test to directly set `skipBundleCreation` property

---

## Next Steps

1. Commit documentation changes
2. Merge all trash branches to main
3. Optional enhancements:
   - File quarantine (copy deleted files to separate storage)
   - Restore preview UI (visual diff)
   - Partial restoration (select which items to restore)
   - Export bundles as JSON backup
   - Queue-based snapshot for large graphs

---

## Usage Examples

### Delete Client (Auto-creates Bundle)
```php
$client = Client::find(1);
$client->delete(); // Bundle automatically created
```

### Restore via Service
```php
$service = app(DeletionBundleService::class);
$report = $service->restoreBundle($bundleId, [
    'dry_run' => false,
    'resolve_conflicts' => 'skip'
]);
```

### CLI Management
```bash
# List recent deletions
php artisan trash:list --limit=10

# Restore specific bundle
php artisan trash:restore abc-123

# Purge old bundles (cron job)
php artisan trash:purge --older-than=90 --force
```
