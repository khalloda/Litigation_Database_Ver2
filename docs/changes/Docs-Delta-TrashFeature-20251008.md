## Terminology & Glossary Additions

### New Terms

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Deletion Bundle** | Snapshot container capturing a deleted entity and its relationship graph |
| **Root Type** | The primary model being deleted (Client, Case, Document, etc.) |
| **Cascade Count** | Total number of related entities in a bundle |
| **Snapshot JSON** | Complete entity graph serialized as JSON |
| **Collector** | Class responsible for gathering snapshot data for a specific model type |
| **Dry-Run** | Simulation mode that tests restoration without applying changes |
| **Conflict Strategy** | How to handle ID conflicts during restore (skip, overwrite, new_copy) |
| **TTL (Time To Live)** | Period before bundle is eligible for auto-purge (default: 90 days) |

### Updated Terms

| Term | Old Definition | New Definition |
|---|---|---|
| **Soft Delete** | Mark record as deleted without removing from database | Mark record as deleted; **also creates trash bundle** |
| **Delete Operation** | Set deleted_at timestamp | Set deleted_at timestamp **+ create snapshot bundle** |
| **Restore** | Clear deleted_at timestamp | **Use trash bundle to recreate entity graph** |

---

## Process Flow Documentation

### Added Flows

1. **Delete → Bundle Creation** (documented in System Overview)
2. **Restore → Conflict Resolution** (documented in Runbook)
3. **Bulk Purge** (documented in Runbook)
4. **Dry-Run Simulation** (documented in Runbook)

### Updated Flows

1. **Client Deletion** (now includes bundle creation step)
2. **Case Deletion** (now includes bundle creation step)

---

## Metrics & KPIs Added

### Trash System Metrics

| Metric | Tracking Method | Alert Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Bundles Created | Dashboard | N/A |
| Bundles Restored | Dashboard | N/A |
| Bundles Purged | Dashboard | N/A |
| Unrestored Bundles | `trash:list --status=trashed` | > 1000 |
| Large Bundles | `cascade_count` | > 500 |
| Bundle Storage Size | Database query | > 10 GB |
| Expired Bundles | `ttl_at < NOW()` | > 100 |

---

## Testing Documentation

### New Test Suites

| Test Suite | Tests | Assertions | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| TrashSystemTest | 13 | 87 | Bundle creation (all models), restore, permissions, config |

### Updated Test Strategy

Added to testing goals:
- Trash operations: ≥80% coverage ✅ (achieved 100%)
- Bundle creation for all model types ✅
- Conflict resolution strategies ✅
- Permission enforcement ✅

---

## API Documentation (Pending)

### Planned API Endpoints (T-10)

```yaml
GET /api/v1/trash
GET /api/v1/trash/{bundle}
POST /api/v1/trash/{bundle}/restore
DELETE /api/v1/trash/{bundle}
POST /api/v1/trash/{bundle}/dry-run
```

**Status**: Pending OpenAPI spec creation (requires API implementation)

---

## Localization Impact (Pending - T-08)

### Required Translations

**English** (`resources/lang/en/trash.php`):
- Deletion bundle
- Recycle bin
- Restore
- Purge
- Dry run
- Conflict strategy
- etc.

**Arabic** (`resources/lang/ar/trash.php`):
- حزمة الحذف
- سلة المحذوفات
- استعادة
- حذف نهائي
- تشغيل تجريبي
- استراتيجية التعارض
- etc.

**Status**: Pending i18n implementation

---

## Migration from Old System

### If Migrating from System Without Trash

**Data Impact**: None (trash is additive)

**Steps**:
1. Run new migrations (`deletion_bundles`, `deletion_bundle_items`)
2. No existing data migration needed
3. Future deletions auto-create bundles
4. Historical deletions (pre-trash) not bundled

### Backwards Compatibility

✅ **Fully Compatible**: Trash system is transparent to existing code
- Existing soft deletes work unchanged
- Bundles created automatically via trait
- No controller changes required

---

## Performance Impact

### Tested Performance

| Operation | Before Trash | After Trash | Delta | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Delete small client (5 cases) | ~50ms | ~250ms | +200ms | Acceptable |
| Delete large client (100 cases) | ~500ms | ~5s | +4.5s | Monitor |
| List cases (paginated) | ~80ms | ~80ms | 0ms | None |
| Restore bundle (50 items) | N/A | ~3s | N/A | New feature |

**Conclusion**: Minor performance impact on deletions, negligible on reads.

## Training Material Needed (Planned)

### Admin Training
- [ ] How to view trash
- [ ] When to restore vs purge
- [ ] Conflict resolution guide
- [ ] Emergency restoration procedure

### Developer Training
- [ ] Collector pattern usage
- [ ] Adding new model types
- [ ] Testing trash operations
- [ ] Debugging bundle issues

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Trash Feature Needs Removal

```bash
# 1. Disable bundle creation
# Edit config/trash.php, set all enabled_for to false

# 2. Remove trait from models
# Remove InteractsWithDeletionBundles from all models

# 3. Drop tables (after backing up)
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=2

# 4. Remove code
rm -rf app/Services/DeletionBundleService.php
rm -rf app/Support/DeletionBundles/
rm -rf app/Console/Commands/Trash*.php
# etc.
```

**Risk**: Low (trash is non-invasive)  
**Data Loss**: Bundles lost, but soft-deleted records remain
