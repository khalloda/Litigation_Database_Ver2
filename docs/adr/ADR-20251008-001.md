# ADR 001: Authentication Choice â€” Laravel UI

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Makers**: Development Team  

## Context

The Central Litigation Management application requires a robust authentication system that supports:
- Email/password authentication
- Password reset functionality
- User registration (controllable)
- Integration with Laravel's existing middleware and guards
- Bootstrap 5 UI compatibility
- Minimal overhead for future customization

Available options include Laravel Breeze, Laravel Jetstream, Laravel UI, and custom implementation.

## Decision

We will use **Laravel UI** with Bootstrap scaffolding for authentication.

## Rationale

1. **Bootstrap 5 Compatibility**: Laravel UI provides native Bootstrap scaffolding, which aligns with our frontend framework choice
2. **Simplicity**: Provides exactly what we need without unnecessary features (unlike Jetstream with teams/API tokens)
3. **Customization**: Easy to modify views and controllers to support bilingual (EN/AR) requirements
4. **Maturity**: Well-established, stable, and widely documented
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Lighter than Jetstream while providing more structure than Breeze

## Consequences

### Positive
- Quick setup with Bootstrap views ready for RTL adaptation
- Familiar structure for Laravel developers
- Easy integration with Spatie Permission for RBAC
- Full control over authentication views and logic

### Negative
- Requires manual implementation of advanced features (2FA, API authentication)
- Less modern than Breeze/Jetstream (but sufficient for our needs)

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Laravel Breeze**: Tailwind-based, would require conversion to Bootstrap
2. **Laravel Jetstream**: Over-featured for our needs (teams, API tokens)
3. **Custom Authentication**: More work, reinventing the wheel
